The first Project Exam I worked on at Noroff.

## Description

This was the Project Exam for my first year.

We were tasked with creating a blog site using "WordPress Rest API". WordPress was used as a "Headless CMS", we fetched the posts created in WordPress with JavaScript over to our own site.

I chose a tech blog because of my interests for "tech stuff".

What I developed:

- Dynamic website
- Sliders on index page with "previous, next" buttons.
- Specific blog pages with image modal.
